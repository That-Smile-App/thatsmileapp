      <h3>Are Smiles More Attractive Than Makeup?</h3>

      {/* 1 */}
      <h4>1. Smiles Signal Genuine Warmth and Approachability</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A smile conveys <strong>friendliness, kindness, and positive emotion</strong>—qualities that makeup
          can’t create on its own.
        </li>
        <li>People naturally respond to these emotional signals, finding smiling faces more attractive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        📚 <strong>Source:</strong> Guéguen & Jacob (2012) found that people who smiled were perceived as more
        likable and attractive in social interactions.

      <h4>2. Makeup Enhances Appearance, But Doesn’t Replace Emotion</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Makeup can <strong>enhance facial features</strong> (even skin tone, eyes, lips), boosting
          attractiveness visually.
        </li>
        <li>
          But makeup alone <strong>doesn’t communicate warmth or personality</strong>; it’s more about
          aesthetics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        📚 <strong>Source:</strong> Jones et al. (2015) showed makeup enhances attractiveness but combined with
        positive expressions like smiling, the effect is stronger.

      <h4>3. Smiling Can Amplify the Effects of Makeup</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When people smile, makeup looks even better because the positive emotional signal enhances overall
          appeal.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>genuine smile</strong> creates a more memorable and attractive impression than makeup
          alone.
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* 4 */}
      <h4>4. Smiles Are Universal and Instantly Rewarding</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Smiles are a <strong>universal social cue</strong> that transcends culture and language, making them
          instantly impactful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Makeup preferences vary culturally and personally, while smiles almost always have a positive effect.

      {/* KEYS TO REMEMBER */}
      <h4>🔑 Keys to Remember</h4>
      <p>
        A <strong>genuine smile</strong> is often more attractive than makeup alone because smiling conveys
        positive emotion, warmth, and approachability—qualities that makeup can’t replace.
