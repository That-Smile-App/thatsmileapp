      <h3>What Is a Duchenne Smile?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s a <strong>genuine smile</strong> that involves two key muscle groups:</li>
        <ul style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Zygomatic major —</strong> pulls up the corners of your mouth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Orbicularis oculi —</strong> causes “crow’s feet” wrinkles around the eyes
            by lifting the cheeks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
          This combination signals true happiness, unlike a <strong>fake or polite smile</strong>,
          which usually only involves the mouth.
        </li>
      </ul>

<h3>🔑 Keys to Remember</h3>
<p><b>The Duchenne smile is more powerful because it’s a true, involuntary expression of joy that signals honesty, builds stronger social bonds, and is linked to greater well-being—making a Duchenne smile much more impactful than a simple polite smile.</b></p>
<p><b>You don’t have to smile with a Duchenne Smile to receive powerful benefits from smiling, but practicing a genuine smile can enhance the benefits you receive.</b></p>
