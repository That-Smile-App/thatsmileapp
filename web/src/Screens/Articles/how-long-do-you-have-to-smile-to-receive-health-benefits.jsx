      {/* WHY SHORT SMILES WORK */}
      <h3>🧠 Why Even Short Smiles Work</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Facial Feedback Loop</strong><br />
          Smiling sends signals to your brain that influence how you feel — even fake or forced smiles can 
          <strong>“trick” your brain</strong> into releasing mood-boosting chemicals.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Instant Nervous System Response</strong><br />
          A quick smile can activate the <strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong>, helping slow heart rate and reduce stress.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Emotion Shift Through Intention</strong><br />
          Even when you don’t feel like smiling, intentionally smiling can <strong>change your emotional state</strong>,
          especially when repeated throughout the day.
        </li>
      </ol>
