Smiling Strengthens Social Bonds — a Major Longevity Factor</p><p>People with strong social connections tend to live longer. Smiling:</p><p>Increases likability and approachability</p><p>Builds and maintains social networks</p><p>Enhances emotional support, which boosts physical and mental resilience</p><p>📚 Study:
Harvard’s 80-year Grant Study found that relationships are one of the strongest predictors of long-term health and longevity.</p><p>Smiling keeps those relationships thriving.</p><p>🔍 4. Smiling Reflects a Positive, Optimistic Outlook — Which Is Linked to Living Longer</p><p>Smiling is often a natural expression of optimism, and studies show that optimistic people are:</p><p>More resilient under pressure</p><p>Less prone to disease</p><p>More likely to engage in healthy behaviors</p><p>📚 Study:
A 2019 study published in PNAS (Lee et al.) found that people with a more optimistic outlook had a 11–15% longer lifespan and were more likely to reach age 85 or older.</p><p>🏈 5.
