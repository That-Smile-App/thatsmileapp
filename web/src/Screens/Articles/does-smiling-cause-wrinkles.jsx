      <h1>Does Smiling Cause Wrinkles?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Smiling itself doesn’t cause wrinkles in a harmful way.</strong> In fact, it’s a natural and
        positive facial movement. However, repeated facial expressions over many years can
        contribute to the formation of <strong>expression lines</strong> (also called dynamic wrinkles).

      {/* -------------------- WHY LINES FORM -------------------- */}
      <h3>Why Smiling Creates Expression Lines</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When you smile, muscles around your eyes (like the orbicularis oculi) and mouth contract,
          creating <strong>temporary lines or creases</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over time, with repeated muscle contractions and natural aging (loss of skin elasticity and
          collagen), these lines can become more permanent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* -------------------- POSITIVE SIDE -------------------- */}
      <h3>But Here’s the Positive Side</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Smiling boosts mood, reduces stress, and improves overall well-being—
          <strong>all of which are better for your skin and health</strong> than constant frowning or stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stress and negative emotions <strong>actually speed up skin aging</strong> by increasing cortisol and
          damaging collagen.
        </li>
      </ul>

          cosmetic concerns.
